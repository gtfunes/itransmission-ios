# iTransmission-iOS

iTransmission for iOS 15+

This port of iTransmission for iOS was initially created by [ccp0101](https://github.com/ccp0101) and hosted at <https://code.google.com/archive/p/itransmission/>

I updated the project to the new recommended settings, fixed a few bugs & things that weren't working.

Everything works, torrent files, magnet links and exporting files to other applications.

The only bug I noticed is that sometimes when deleting a torrent the app crashes.
